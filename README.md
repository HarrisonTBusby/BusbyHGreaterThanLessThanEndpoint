# BusbyHGreaterThanLessThanEndpoint

This program takes two user inputted numbers in the URL and the the terminal tells you if the numbers are greater than, less than, or equal to each other. 

//Peer reviewed by Dan Decoito: The API and program both run well and meets the criteria for the assignment. Good use of if statments. Good job Harrison :)
